Fast and accurate prediction of <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra from the molecular structure plays an important
role in structure validation and elucidation of molecules. The NMR predictor application is able to predict NMR spectra for
standard organic molecules containing the most freuqent atoms (H, C, N, O, F, Cl, Br, I, P, S). <br><br>

Basic features:
<UL>
	<LI> Prediction of <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>1</sup>H NMR chemical shifts. </LI>
	<LI> Prediction of vicinal proton-proton coupling constants in case of <sup>1</sup>H NMR. </LI>
	<LI> Spin-spin couplings are taken into account according to the first order approximation. </LI>
</UL>

The NMR graphical user interface incorporates the following features:
<UL>
	<LI> Toggle between coupled and decoupled NMR spectra. (only in case of <sup>1</sup>H NMR) </LI>
	<LI> Visualization of realistic and stick NMR spectra. </LI>
	<LI> Integral function of the NMR spectrum can be shown. </LI>
	<LI> Toggle between ppm and Hz units. </LI>
	<LI> Visualization of atom indices corresponding to the different multiplets. </LI>
	<LI> Atoms of the input molecule and multiplets of the NMR spectrum are linked together.
		 Upon selection of an atom the corresponding multiplet is highlighted and vice versa. </LI>
	<LI> NMR measurement frequency can be chosen from a predefined list. </LI>
	<LI> Zoom in and out. </LI>
	<LI> Create new NMR prediction projects, open existing NMR projects and save NMR projects. </LI>
	<LI> A single NMR project is allowed to contain more molecules. </LI>
	<LI> New molecules can be drawn or imported from SMILES or file, existing molecules are free to edit. </LI>
</UL>
The current beta version is primarily for testing and can change in the future.
Chemical shifts are estimated by a linear model based on a topological description scheme.
In case of <sup>1</sup>H NMR vicinal proton-proton coupling constants are computed by the Karplus equation.
